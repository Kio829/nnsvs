NNSVS
=====

Neural network based singing voice synthesis library

Audio samples
-------------

- Samples by r9y9: https://soundcloud.com/r9y9/sets/dnn-based-singing-voice
- Samples by NNSVS/ENUNU community: `YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=nnsvs+enunu>`_, `NicoNico <https://www.nicovideo.jp/search/nnsvs?ref=nicotop_search>`_

Installation
-------------


For development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code::

   git clone https://github.com/r9y9/nnsvs.git && cd nnsvs
   pip install -e ".[lint.test]"

Note: adding ``[lint,test]`` to the end of the command above will install test/lint requirements as well.

For inference only
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code::

   pip install nnsvs

If you don't need to train your models by yourself (I guess it's unlikely though), this should be enough.
